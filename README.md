EXISTING SOLUTION in Detection and Analysis of Fake news
Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems. It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
Bayes Theorem provides a principled way for calculating the conditional probability. The simple form of the calculation for Bayes Theorem is as follows: 
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

NOVELTY / RECOMMENDED SOLUTION
Support Vector Machine Classifier along with Natural Language Processing

The suggested model is an approach that combines supervised artificial intelligence algorithms and text analysis techniques. Text mining techniques have been used to analyse the internet news data set in the initial phase of this project. To extract structured data from an unstructured news story is the goal of text analysis methodologies and techniques. supervised artificial intelligence algorithms are used in the second step.

Machine learning is the term given to algorithms that allow computers to analyse data, pick up potential patterns and use them to make predictions. Learning algorithms can provide insight into the relative difficulty of learning in different environments [8]. Machine learning algorithms fall into several categories, but his two most common types are supervised and unsupervised learning. A supervised learning algorithm has generated a function that transforms an input into a desired output. The main forms of supervised learning algorithms are regression and classification. Unsupervised learning models a collection of inputs without labelled examples.
This solution proposes using machine learning techniques to build a flight delay prediction model.
